## Overview

Adding your first charger involves three main steps:
1. Creating a charger group
2. Adding a charger
3. Connecting the charger to GridFlow Core

Let's get started!

## Creating a Charger Group

<Info>
  It's crucial to create a Charger Group before adding individual chargers. A Charger Group is designed for a specific location and class of chargers, allowing for unified tariff application.

## Connecting Your Charger

<Note>
  GridFlow supports EV chargers made by 3000+ manufacturers that run on the OCPP1.6J Protocols.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve WebSocket Endpoint">
    Click on the charger you just added in GridFlow Core. A modal will pop up with the WebSocket config URL for your charger.

    <Info>
      The endpoint format is: `wss://core.grdflo.com/ocpp/1.6/central_system/<charge_point_id>`
      
      Replace `<charge_point_id>` with your actual charge point ID.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure WebSocket Connection">
    <Accordion title="Detailed Connection Steps">
      1. Access the charge point's configuration interface (refer to your manufacturer's manual).
      2. Locate the section for inputting the WebSocket URL.
      3. Enter the provided URL, ensuring the correct charge point ID is included.
      4. Save the settings and restart your charge point if necessary.
    </Accordion>
    <Warning>
      The exact steps may vary depending on your charger's make and model. Always consult your manufacturer's documentation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Initial Connection">
    Ensure the charge point sends a Boot Notification upon startup. This confirms the connection to the central system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Ongoing Communication">
    <Accordion title="Heartbeat and Status Notifications">
      - Configure regular heartbeat messages (interval typically set in charge point settings).
      - Ensure the charge point sends status notifications (e.g., Available, SuspendedEVSE, Unavailable).
      - Monitor these notifications in the central system.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

##  Verification

If everything went smoothly, you should now see:
- Your charger's status on the Charger Network page as "Available"
- 1 Online charger in the Total Charger Statistics
