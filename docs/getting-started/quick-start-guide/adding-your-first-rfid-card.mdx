<Note>
  This guide assumes you have already added a charger to GridFlow Core. If you haven't, please refer to the [Adding Your First Charger](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide/adding-your-first-charger) guide first.
</Note>

## Overview

Adding your first RFID card involves two main steps:
1. Creating a Card Holder
2. Creating an Access Profile and restriction limits
3. Adding an RFID card to the Card Holder

Let's get started!

## Understanding Access Methods

<Info>
  Before adding an RFID card, it's important to understand the two primary ways to use chargers in the GridFlow Core System.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Using RFID" icon="id-card">
    This is the primary method for your team and internal members. You'll manually set up RFID Cards for each user, making it unsuitable for public use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Using GridFlow Drive" icon="mobile-screen">
    This method is designed for public usage. Users can access your chargers through the GridFlow Drive Web or Mobile App by scanning a QR code on the EV Charger.
  </Card>

## Creating a Card Holder

<Info>
  It's essential to create a Card Holder before adding individual RFID cards. A Card Holder represents the primary person who will be using the card and serves as the point of contact for anything related to this card.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Access Control">
    Access the Access Control page from the sidebar on the left.
    
    <Frame caption="GridFlow Core Navigation">

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Card Holders tab">
    Click on the "Card Holders" tab in the Access Control page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add new Card Holder">

## Creating an Access Profile

<Info>
  Before adding RFID cards, you need to create an Access Profile that defines when and where the cards can be used. Access Profiles help manage permissions across your charging network.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Access Profiles">
    On the Access Control page, click on the "Access Profiles" tab.
    
    <Frame caption="Access Profiles Tab">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Profile">
    Click on the "Create New Access Profile" button in the top right of the table. A modal will open.
